The initial intent of this board support is simply to assist in the CC13x0 architecture development. Serious board development will occur later.

DIO6_RLED  CR2  High output illuminuates
</code></pre><p>If CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is not defined, then the user can control the LEDs in any way. The definitions provided in the board.h header file can be used to access individual LEDs.</p><p>These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined. In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in include/board.h and src/cc1312_autoleds.c. The LEDs are used to encode OS-related events as follows:</p><pre><code>SYMBOL              Meaning                  LED state
                                            GLED   RLED

LED_STARTED        NuttX has been started   OFF    OFF
LED_HEAPALLOCATE   Heap has been allocated  OFF    ON
LED_IRQSENABLED    Interrupts enabled       OFF    ON
LED_STACKCREATED   Idle stack created       ON     OFF
LED_INIRQ          In an interrupt          N/C    GLOW
LED_SIGNAL         In a signal handler      N/C    GLOW

LED_IDLE           MCU is is sleep mode      Not used
</code></pre><p>Thus iF GLED is statically on, NuttX has successfully booted and is, apparently, running normally. A soft glow of the RLED means that the board is taking interrupts. If GLED is off and GLED is flashing at approximately 2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.</p><h2 id="buttons" tabindex="-1">Buttons <a class="header-anchor" href="#buttons" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Buttons&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The LaunchXL-CC1310 has two push-puttons:</p><p>DIO13_BTN1 SW1 Low input sensed when depressed DIO14_BTN2 SW2 Low input sensed when depressed</p><h1 id="using-j-link" tabindex="-1">Using J-Link <a class="header-anchor" href="#using-j-link" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Using J-Link&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Reference <a href="https://wiki.segger.com/CC1310%5C_LaunchPad:" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://wiki.segger.com/CC1310\\_LaunchPad:</a></p><p>When shipped, the TI CC1310 LaunchPad evaluation board is configured to be used with the on-board debug probe. In order to use it with J-Link, the on-board debug probe needs to be isolated to make sure that it does not drive the debug signals. This can be done by removing some jumpers next to the XDS110 Out / CC1310 In connector [RXD, TXD, RST, TMS, TCK, TDO, TDI, SWO]. After isolating the on-board probe, the CC130F128 device can be debugged using J-Link. The J-Link needs to be connected to the board using the micro JTAG connector marked &quot;In&quot;.</p><p>I use the Olimex ARM-JTAG-20-10 to interface with the board: <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG-20-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG-20-10/</a></p><p>NOTE: When connecting the J-Link GDB server, the interface must be set to JTAG, not SWD as you might expect.</p><p>The RXD/TXD pins. PA0/U0RX and PA1/U0TX, can then support a Serial console using the appropriate TTL adapter (TTL to RS-232 or TTL to USB serial).</p>`,26)]))}const b=t(s,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,b as default};
