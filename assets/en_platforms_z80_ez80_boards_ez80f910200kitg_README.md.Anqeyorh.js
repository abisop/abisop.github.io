However, it is the older version 4.11.0 that this code has been verified against.</p><p>Version 5.1.1</p><p>On June 22, 2011 I verified that these configurations build successfully with the 5.1.1 ZDS-II version. On November 12, 2012, all of the configurations were converted to use 5.1.1, but have not been verified on a running target.</p><p>The above kludge for 4.11.0 is not required with 5.1.1.</p><p>Paths were also updated that are specific to a 32-bit toolchain running on a 64 bit windows platform. Change to a different toolchain, you will need to modify the versioning in Make.defs; if you want to build on a different platform, you will need to change the path in the ZDS binaries in that files and also in your PATH environment variable.</p><p>Version 5.2.1</p><p>On January 31, 2016, I tried ZDS-II version 5.2.1. I believe that I have all of the changes in place to support that version. At compile time, however, I encountered compiler internal errors. I did not pursue that build any further.</p><p>Version 5.3.0</p><p>I verified compilation using 5.30 on June 2, 2019. To use this version, I had to make spurious modification to the implementation of gmtimer() to work around an internal compiler error. I have still not verified that are no errors in the compiled code.</p><p>Other Versions If you use any version of ZDS-II other than 5.1.1, 5.2.1, or 5.3.0 or if you install ZDS-II at any location other than the default location, you will have to modify three files: (1) arch/arm/z80/src/ez80/Kconfig, (2) boards/z80/ez80/ez80f910200kitg/scripts/Make.defs and, perhaps, (3) arch/z80/src/ez80/Toolchain.defs.</p><p>Configuration Subdirectories ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p><ul><li>src/ and include/ These directories contain common logic for all ez80f910200kitg configurations.</li></ul><p>Variations on the basic ez80f910200kitg configuration are maintained in subdirectories. To configure any specific configuration, do the following steps:</p><p>tools/configure.sh ez80f910200kitg:<code>&lt;sub-directory&gt;</code> make</p><p>Where <code>&lt;sub-directory&gt;</code> is the specific board configuration that you wish to build. The following board-specific configurations are available:</p><ul><li><p>ostest This builds the examples/ostest application for execution from FLASH. See examples/README.txt for information about ostest.</p><p>NOTES:</p><ol><li><p>This configuration uses the mconf-based configuration tool. To change this configuration using that tool, you should:</p><p>a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool. See nuttx/README.txt see additional README.txt files in the NuttX tools repository.</p><p>b. Execute &#39;make menuconfig&#39; in nuttx/ in order to start the reconfiguration process.</p></li><li><p>By default, this configuration assumes that you are using the Cygwin environment on Windows. An option is to use the native CMD.exe window build as described in the top-level README.txt file. To set up that configuration:</p><p>-CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y +CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE=y</p><p>And after configuring, make sure that CONFIG_APPS_DIR uses the back slash character. For example:</p><p>CONFIG_APPS_DIR=&quot;..<code>\\apps</code>&quot;</p></li></ol><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>&lt;!-- --&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><pre><code>NOTES:

a. If you need to change the toolchain path used in Make.defs, you
   will need to use the short 8.3 filenames to avoid spaces.  On my
   PC, C:\\PROGRA~1\\ is is C:\\Program Files\\ and C:\\PROGRA~2\\ is
   C:\\Program Files (x86)\\
b. At present, the native Windows build fails at the final link stages.
   The failure is due to problems in arch/z80/src/nuttx.linkcmd that
   is autogenerated by arch/z80/src/Makefile.zdsii.  The basic problem
   is the spurious spaces and and carrirage returns are generated at
   the end of the lines after a line continuation (\\ ^M).  If these
   trailing bad characters are manually eliminated, then the build
   will succeed on the next try.
