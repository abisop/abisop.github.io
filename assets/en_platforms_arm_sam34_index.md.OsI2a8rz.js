The ATSAM4LC4C comes in a 100-pin package and has 256KB FLASH and 32KB of SRAM. Below is the current memory usage for the NSH configuration (June 9, 2013). This is <em>not</em> a minimal implementation, but a full-featured NSH configuration.</p><p>Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:</p><p>NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 42.6KB of FLASH leaving 213.4B of FLASH (83.4%) free from additional application development. Static SRAM usage is about 2.3KB (&lt;7%) and leaves 29.7KB (92.7%) available for heap at runtime.</p><p>SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command. This runtime memory usage includes the static memory usage <em>plus</em> all dynamic memory allocation for things like stacks and I/O buffers:</p><p>You can see that 22.8KB (71.1%) of the SRAM heap is still available for further application development while NSH is running.</p><h2 id="microchip-sam4cm" tabindex="-1">Microchip SAM4CM <a class="header-anchor" href="#microchip-sam4cm" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Microchip SAM4CM&quot;">​</a></h2><p>General architectural support was provided for SAM4CM family in NuttX 7.3 This was <em>architecture-only</em> support, meaning that support for the boards with these chips is available, but no support for any publicly available boards was included.
