This check will also run automatically during CI to ensure conformance.</p><p>Note that not all existing files in the repository are already adapted to conform to the standard as this is an ongoing effort. Thus, if you&#39;re submitting a patch to an existing file you may have to make the file conform to the standard, even if you are not responsible for those standard violations.</p><p>It is also appreciated that you separate any styling fixes in a separate commit from the functional changes so that these are more easily readable during review.</p></li><li><p>Before starting work on any given non trivial contribution, do subscribe to the mailing list and ask about your idea to avoid wasted effort by going the wrong-route.</p></li><li><p>If you are submitting an original contribution (you wrote the code yourself from scratch) it will have to be submitted under the terms of the Apache 2.0 License using the corresponding <code>header &lt;contributing/coding_style:Appendix&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;}.</p><p>Note that if you are working as an employee in a company, usually copyright belongs to the company and thus this means the company will have to authorize this and submit the appropriate license agreements.</p></li><li><p>If you are submitting third-party code:</p><ul><li><p>Code from actively developed projects is not accepted to be included in NuttX (i.e.: creating a fork).
