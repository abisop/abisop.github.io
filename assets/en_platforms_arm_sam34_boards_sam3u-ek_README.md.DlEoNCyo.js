Usage of these LEDs is defined in include/board.h and src/up_leds.c. They are encoded as follows:</p><pre><code>SYMBOL              Meaning                 LED0*   LED1    LED2
------------------- ----------------------- ------- ------- -------
LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  OFF     OFF     OFF
LED_HEAPALLOCATE    Heap has been allocated OFF     OFF     ON
LED_IRQSENABLED     Interrupts enabled      OFF     ON      OFF

</code></pre><ul><li>If LED1 and LED2 are statically on, then NuttX probably failed to boot and these LEDs will give you some indication of where the failure was ** The normal state is LED0=OFF, LED2=ON and LED1 faintly glowing. This faint glow is because of timer interrupts that result in the LED being illuminated on a small proportion of the time. *** LED2 may also flicker normally if signals are processed.</li></ul><p>Serial Console ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p><p>By default, all of these configurations use UART0 for the NuttX serial console. UART0 corresponds to the DB-9 connector labelled &quot;UART&quot;. This is a male connector and will require a female-to-female, NUL modem cable to connect to a PC.</p><p>An alternate is USART1 which connects to the other DB-9 connector labeled &quot;USART&quot;. USART1 is not enabled by default unless specifically noted otherwise in the configuration description. A NUL modem cable must be used with the port as well.</p><p>NOTE: One of the USART1 pins is shared with the audio CODEC. The audio CODEC cannot be used of USART1 is enabled.</p><p>By default serial console is configured for 115000, 8-bit, 1 stop bit, and no parity.</p><p>SAM3U-EK-specific Configuration Options ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p><pre><code>CONFIG_ARCH - Identifies the arch/ subdirectory.

It is recommends to use a special make command; not just &#39;make&#39; but make with the following two arguments:</p><pre><code>    make pass1 pass2

In the normal case (just &#39;make&#39;), make will attempt to build both user-
and kernel-mode blobs more or less interleaved.  This actual works!
However, for me it is very confusing so I prefer the above make command:
Make the user-space binaries first (pass1), then make the kernel-space
binaries (pass2)

NOTES:

1. At the end of the build, there will be several files in the top-level
   NuttX build directory:

   PASS1:
     nuttx_user.elf    - The pass1 user-space ELF file
     nuttx_user.hex    - The pass1 Intel HEX format file (selected in defconfig)
     User.map          - Symbols in the user-space ELF file

   PASS2:
     nuttx             - The pass2 kernel-space ELF file
     nuttx.hex         - The pass2 Intel HEX file (selected in defconfig)
     System.map        - Symbols in the kernel-space ELF file

   The J-Link programmer will accept files in .hex, .mot, .srec, and .bin
   formats.

2. Combining .hex files.  If you plan to use the .hex files with your
   debugger or FLASH utility, then you may need to combine the two hex
   files into a single .hex file.  Here is how you can do that.

   a. The &#39;tail&#39; of the nuttx.hex file should look something like this
      (with my comments added):

        $ tail nuttx.hex
        # 00, data records
        ...
        :10 9DC0 00 01000000000800006400020100001F0004
        :10 9DD0 00 3B005A0078009700B500D400F300110151
        :08 9DE0 00 30014E016D0100008D
        # 05, Start Linear Address Record
        :04 0000 05 0800 0419 D2
        # 01, End Of File record
        :00 0000 01 FF

      Use an editor such as vi to remove the 05 and 01 records.

   b. The &#39;head&#39; of the nuttx_user.hex file should look something like
      this (again with my comments added):

        $ head nuttx_user.hex
        # 04, Extended Linear Address Record
        :02 0000 04 0801 F1
        # 00, data records
        :10 8000 00 BD89 01084C800108C8110208D01102087E
        :10 8010 00 0010 00201C1000201C1000203C16002026
        :10 8020 00 4D80 01085D80010869800108ED83010829
        ...

      Nothing needs to be done here.  The nuttx_user.hex file should
      be fine.

   c. Combine the edited nuttx.hex and un-edited nuttx_user.hex
      file to produce a single combined hex file:

      $ cat nuttx.hex nuttx_user.hex &gt;combined.hex

   Then use the combined.hex file with the to write the FLASH image.
   If you do this a lot, you will probably want to invest a little time
   to develop a tool to automate these steps.
</code></pre><p>nsh: Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh. The Configuration enables both the serial and telnetd NSH interfaces.</p><pre><code>NOTES:

1. NSH built-in applications are supported.  However, there are
   no built-in applications built with the default configuration.

   Binary Formats:
     CONFIG_BUILTIN=y                    : Enable support for built-in programs

   Application Configuration:
     CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS=y           : Enable starting apps from NSH command line

2. This configuration has been used for verifying the touchscreen on
   on the SAM3U-EK LCD.  With these modifications, you can include the
   touchscreen test program at apps/examples/touchscreen as an NSH built-in
   application.  You can enable the touchscreen and test by modifying the
   default configuration in the following ways:

      Device Drivers
        CONFIG_SPI=y                      : Enable SPI support
        CONFIG_SPI_EXCHANGE=y             : The exchange() method is supported

        CONFIG_INPUT=y                    : Enable support for input devices
        CONFIG_INPUT_ADS7843E=y           : Enable support for the XPT2046
        CONFIG_ADS7843E_SPIDEV=2          : Use SPI CS 2 for communication
        CONFIG_ADS7843E_SPIMODE=0         : Use SPI mode 0
        CONFIG_ADS7843E_FREQUENCY=1000000 : SPI BAUD 1MHz
        CONFIG_ADS7843E_SWAPXY=y          : If landscpe orientation
        CONFIG_ADS7843E_THRESHX=51        : These will probably need to be tuned
        CONFIG_ADS7843E_THRESHY=39

      System Type -&gt; Peripherals:
        CONFIG_SAM34_SPI0=y               : Enable support for SPI

      System Type:
        CONFIG_SAM34_GPIO_IRQ=y           : GPIO interrupt support
        CONFIG_SAM34_GPIOA_IRQ=y          : Enable GPIO interrupts from port A

      Library Support:
        CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE=y          : Work queue support required

      Application Configuration:
        CONFIG_EXAMPLES_TOUCHSCREEN=y     : Enable the touchscreen built-int test

      Defaults should be okay for related touchscreen settings.  Touchscreen
      debug output on UART0 can be enabled with:

      Build Setup:
        CONFIG_DEBUG_FEATURES=y           : Enable debug features
        CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y               : Enable verbose debug output
        CONFIG_DEBUG_INPUT=y              : Enable debug output from input devices

3. Enabling HSMCI support. The SAM3U-KE provides a an SD memory card
   slot.  Support for the SD slot can be enabled with the following
   settings:

   System Type-&gt;ATSAM3/4 Peripheral Support
     CONFIG_SAM34_HSMCI=y                 : Enable HSMCI support
     CONFIG_SAM34_DMAC0=y                 : DMAC support is needed by HSMCI

   System Type
     CONFIG_SAM34_GPIO_IRQ=y              : PIO interrupts needed
     CONFIG_SAM34_GPIOA_IRQ=y             : Card detect pin is on PIOA

   Device Drivers -&gt; MMC/SD Driver Support
     CONFIG_MMCSD=y                       : Enable MMC/SD support
     CONFIG_MMSCD_NSLOTS=1                : One slot per driver instance

     CONFIG_MMCSD_SDIO=y                  : SDIO-based MMC/SD support
     CONFIG_SDIO_DMA=y                    : Use SDIO DMA
     CONFIG_SDIO_BLOCKSETUP=y             : Needs to know block sizes

   Library Routines
     CONFIG_SCHED_WORKQUEUE=y             : Driver needs work queue support

   Application Configuration -&gt; NSH Library
     CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y                : NSH board-initialization

STATUS:
  2013-6-28: The touchscreen is functional.
  2013-6-29: Hmmm... but there appear to be conditions when the
    touchscreen driver locks up.  Looks like some issue with
    managing the interrupts.
  2013-6-30:  Those lock-ups appear to be due to poorly placed
    debug output statements.  If you do not enable debug output,
    the touchscreen is rock-solid.
  2013-8-10:  Added the comments above above enabling HSMCI memory
    card support and verified that the configuration builds without
    error.  However, that configuration has not yet been tested (and
    is may even be incomplete).
