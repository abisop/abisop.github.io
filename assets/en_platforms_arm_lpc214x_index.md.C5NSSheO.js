In particular, support is provided for (1) the mcu123.com lpc214x evaluation board (LPC2148) and (1) the The0.net ZPA213X/4XPA development board (with the The0.net UG-2864AMBAG01 OLED) This port also used the GNU arm-nuttx-elf toolchain* under Linux or Cygwin.</p><p><a href="http://www.nxp.com/pip/LPC2141FBD64.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://www.nxp.com/pip/LPC2141FBD64.html</a></p><p>The LPC2141/42/44/46/48 microcontrollers are based on a 16-bit/32-bit ARM7TDMI-S CPU with real-time emulation and embedded trace support, that combine microcontroller with embedded high-speed flash memory ranging from 32 kB to 512 kB. A 128-bit wide memory interface and a unique accelerator architecture enable 32-bit code execution at the maximum clock rate. For critical code size applications, the alternative 16-bit Thumb mode reduces code by more than 30 pct with minimal performance penalty.</p><p>Due to their tiny size and low power consumption, LPC2141/42/44/46/48 are ideal for applications where miniaturization is a key requirement, such as access control and point-of-sale. Serial communications interfaces ranging from a USB 2.0 Full-speed device, multiple UARTs, SPI, SSP to I2C-bus and on-chip SRAM of 8 kB up to 40 kB, make these devices very well suited for communication gateways and protocol converters, soft modems, voice recognition and low end imaging, providing both large buffer size and high processing power. Various 32-bit timers, single or dual 10-bit ADC(s), 10-bit DAC, PWM channels and 45 fast GPIO lines with up to nine edge or level sensitive external interrupt pins make these microcontrollers suitable for industrial control and medical systems.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Features&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>16-bit/32-bit ARM7TDMI-S microcontroller in a tiny LQFP64 package.</li><li>8 kB to 40 kB of on-chip static RAM and 32 kB to 512 kB of on-chip flash memory. 128-bit wide interface/accelerator enables high-speed 60 MHz operation.</li><li>In-System Programming/In-Application Programming (ISP/IAP) via on-chip boot loader software.
