A port of NuttX to the Beaglebone Black board was first released in NuttX-7.28. This port was contributed by Petro Karashchenko. This board is based on the TI/Sitara AM3358 Cortex-A8 CPU running 1GHz.</p><ul><li><strong>NuttX-7.28</strong>. This initial port in NuttX-7.28 is very sparse. While not ready for production use, the Beaglebone Black port is functional and will be the basis for a more extensive development. Additional work in progress to extend this port and more capable is anticipated in NuttX-7.29.</li><li><strong>NuttX-9.0</strong> CAN support was added.
