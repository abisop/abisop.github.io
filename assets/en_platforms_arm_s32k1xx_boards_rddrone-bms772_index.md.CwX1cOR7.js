Design files are available on the NXP website and may be used to develop your own BMS. RDDRONE-BMS772 is configurable and supports batteries of 3 to 6 cells, which it can monitor individually. The board features the <a href="https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/s32-automotive-platform/s32k-general-purpose-mcus/s32k1-microcontrollers-for-general-purpose:S32K1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NXP S32K144</a> MCU, which can monitor the <a href="https://www.nxp.com/products/power-management/battery-management/battery-cell-controllers/6-channel-li-ion-battery-cell-controller-ic:MC33772B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NXP MC33772B</a> Battery Cell Controller (BCC) and may communicates with the Vehicle Management Unit (VMU). When faults are detected the battery output can be disconnected to prevent further damage. Status information may be communicated over I2C/SMBus, CAN or NFC.</p><p>NuttX contains basic board support RDDRONE-BMS772, which allows the S32K144 MCU to be initialized. A NuttX-compatible smart battery application for RDDRONE-BMS772 is also available. It contains additional drivers and example software to use most features of the battery management system. This application is currently published in a <a href="https://github.com/NXPHoverGames/RDDRONE-BMS772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">separate repository</a>, but (parts) may eventually be upstreamed to Apache NuttX.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Features&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li></li></ul><pre><code>NXP FS32K144HAT0MLFT MCU
